## Introduction 
With this project we aim to create a centralized and one stop solution to enable the targeted users with a chance to interact with the website and locate for their nearest shelter home (and/or) find their next pet to adopt which would otherwise be a troublesome process like manually searching for shelter homes (and/or) pets in Newspapers, Magazines, Mutual Connections, Internet Articles, etc. Through this project there is better connectivity among the shelters and the potential adopters, keeping Animal Rescue in mind. The individuals registered with the application can also get in touch with their nearest animal rescue shelters in case they find a victim of animal abuse. The platform also provides the ability to sort the nearby shelters on the basis of their ranking that is found by applying sentiment analysis on the reviews left by previous users who interacted with the shelter.

## Setup
